### Hi I am Wylliam 🍪

Currently: a student studying computer science, data science, and biomedical engineering 😆  
Futuristically: a software developer involved in wide range of areas 🤣 

## My obsessions:
- Artificial General Intelligence / Generative AI 🤖
- Pathology 🦠
- Genetics 🧬
- Brain Computer Interface 🧠
- Building software in general 💻

## Things I have done:
1. Android App (Quite a while ago and did not save on GitHub 😢)
      - I do have a video 🤭 link: [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/1h5AN02Lfs4)
2. Arduino building a red light therapy testing device (experiment purpose) (again, no code saved 😢)
      - some circuit wiring and coding 😝
      - video presentation link: [Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HKBMXxRPRHany2UjMTYETK4QKEFj6E00/view?usp=share_link)
